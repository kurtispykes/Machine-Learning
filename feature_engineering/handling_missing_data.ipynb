    "In the last series of PyTrix we touched on Missing data; Here's an excerpt from the last PyTrix \"When we observe missing values within our data, it is as a result of no data value being stored in the particular variable for an observation. Missing data is extremely common in practice and can have a large effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data, hence why a huge portion of Data Scientist time is attributed towards data cleaning.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "We explored ways to detect missing Data, but in that post I did not give a clear solution as to how we should go about combating the problem of missing data. In this post I hope to run through some strategies that I've found useful and because this is PyTrix, of-course I am going to share some useful Python tricks we could use to perform these task. \n",
